word-clock
==========

A jQuery-based Word Clock for the web.  This creates a page that displays a matrix of 
words and highlights relevant ones for the current time.  For instance, 6:15 would 
be displayed with the following words/phrases highlighted: "It is", "quarter", 
"past", "six". All other words in the word-matrix would be greyed out.  It runs once
per minute to check and display updates, if necessary.

This is based on a picture of such a clock seen online.
